            We offer a Cash on Delivery (COD) option for customers who prefer to
            pay in cash at the time of delivery. This service is available
            across select locations. Please note that a nominal fee may apply
            for this service, which will be indicated during the checkout
            process. Ensure that you have the exact amount ready for a smooth
            delivery experience, as our delivery personnel may not carry change.
