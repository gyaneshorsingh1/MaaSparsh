        <h1>Cancellation Policy – Maasparash Essence of Ayurveda</h1>

        <p>
          At Maasparash Essence of Ayurveda, we understand that sometimes plans
          change. We aim to make the order cancellation process as simple and
          hassle-free as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Easy Cancellations – No Questions Asked</h2>
        <p>
          You can cancel your order within 2 hours of placing it, no questions
          asked, directly from your account dashboard or by contacting our
          customer support team at <strong>[email/contact number]</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Cancellation After Dispatch</h2>
        <p>
          If your order has already been processed and dispatched, we are unable
          to cancel it. However, you can still return the products after they
          are delivered by following our{" "}
          <a href="/return-refund-policy">Return & Refund Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Pre-Order Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          If you have placed a pre-order for an upcoming product release, you
          can cancel your pre-order any time before the product is shipped. Once
          shipped, the standard return process applies.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How to Cancel an Order</h2>

        <h2>5. Refund Processing</h2>
        <p>
          For prepaid orders, refunds for canceled orders will be processed
          within 7 business days. The amount will be credited back to the
          original payment method you used while placing the order. If you paid
          via <strong>Cash on Delivery (COD)</strong>, no refunds are applicable
          as no payment would have been collected.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Cancellation of Incorrect or Fraudulent Orders</h2>
        <p>
          If we detect an order placed under fraudulent circumstances or with
          incorrect information, we reserve the right to cancel the order and
          issue a full refund to the customer.
